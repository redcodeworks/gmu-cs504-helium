## Introduction
### Background and Rationale
Pitchfork reviews are well-known for having the ability to make or break an album-as well as an artist’s career. This website is referred to by many as “the most vital and polarizing music publication of its era” [Harvilla]. The online publication has gained a reputation as a renowned arbiter of independent music, scoring albums on a 10-point point system. For example, Nick Jonas’s album, Spaceman, received a mediocre 5.8 [Horn] while Adele’s 21 was awarded a smooth 8.2 [Blum]. The goal of this analysis is to quantify a largely subjective, mostly secret review system, and to create a model that outputs scores that are consistent with the scores given by Pitchfork based on the written reviews.

The system used by Pitchfork reviewers to score music is largely kept secret and widely considered subjective. The written review comes first, and then editors individually score the album based on the review and the music [Harvilla]. The contributors scores are mostly subjective, but are also based on a secret, rarely mentioned, four-volume publication called the Pitchfork Ratings Guide [Patel, Et al.]. However, the ratings are not only based on the Pitchfork Ratings Guide, but also many subjective questions, such as how the album compares to the artists other works and how it will age over time [Harvilla]. In Harvilla’s conversation with the founder of Pitchfork, Ryan Scrieber stated “I liked that it felt kind of scientific without any actual science to it” about the 10 point rating system. 

It is rare for an album to receive a perfect score from a Pitchfork review, one of the most recent perfect scores being awarded to Fiona Apple’s Fetch the Bolt Cutters album in April of 2020 [Pelly]. This perfect score came 10 years after the previous perfect score, awarded to Kanye West’s album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in November, 2010 [Dombal].  In the review of Apple’s album, author Jenn Pelly states that the album is “unbound, a wild symphony of the everyday, an unyielding masterpiece” [Pelly]. This project seeks to understand if the words used in a Pitchfork review correlate with a higher album score.

Pitchfork, which started as a magazine but quickly transformed itself into a website, began publishing album reviews daily in the mid 1990’s [Harvilla]. The most recent owner of Pitchfork Media is Condé Nast, a publisher that owns popular magazines such as Vogue and Vanity Fair [Somaiya]. Ryan Schreiber, former publisher and one of the site’s top editors (until he stepped down in 2018) [Kelly], was considered “one of the 25 most powerful people in the music industry” [Freedom du Lac]. This shows just how much power Pitchfork holds in the ruthless music industry. 

A bad review from this website can tank an artist's career with the click of the mouse. One of the most notorious reviews from Pitchfork was of Travis Morrison’s Travistan album, which scored 0.0 points. After this review, several radio stations refused to play music from the album [Itzkoff].  While the site has the power to bring an artist to his or her knees, it also has the power to catapult a relatively unknown artist into stardom, as it did with the band Arcade Fire. In 2004, the band's album, titled Funeral, received a 9.7 score on Pitchfork. Soon after the publication of  the review, the album became the fastest-selling title in the history of Merge Records to date [Freedom du Lac]. 

The influence a single Pitchfork review can have on an album and/or an artist is one of the reasons it is important to study these reviews in-depth. It can help artists understand what aspects of the album are most important towards receiving a great review and on what reviewers are focused when listening to an album. It can help an artist keep their career afloat. It is interesting that subjective reviews hold such power, and the ability to quantify the subjective wording of the reviews may reveal something interesting about the reviews themselves.
